Dune imperium code for data analysis from hidden assets.
If you find any errors contact krompl on discord.

main.py turns discord bot output into csv style data. (need to make sure regex is correct when adding new data for new player names)

leader_percentage.py analysis the data.

dataset.txt only contains data for up to game 967. This is season 7 games with sandstorm.

dataset_no_sandstorm_s7.txt only contains games from 968 until 1182 (s7 no sandsorm)

Resubmits up to this game have been manually removed from dataset.txt and ns  until 1182
